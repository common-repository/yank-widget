**Using Yank Widget**

1. Go to the Design > Widgets panel and add a Yank Widget to a sidebar.
2. Check the Yank Widget settings. You can override the page title with a custom title or hide the title. You can also set the widget to always show the yank widget sidebar container HTML even if you don't have content for that yank widget.
3. Create a page you intend to display in a sidebar. Remember, most sidebar areas are small, so limit and format your pages appropriately.
4. Edit another page or post where you want your recently created page content to appear in the sidebar.
4. Look for the Yank Widget settings below the Advanced Options area.
5. You can select any page content for a particular Yank Widget. You can also select if you want Yank Widget to hide that page from menus and page lists.
6. Save your page or post and view it to see the results.

If you are using a caching solution such as WP Super Cache, you may need to   clear the plugins' cache on your website, or wait for the cache to update.
